The ancient thinkers discovered that diversities define the creation, but an inherent unity threads it into a single unified whole. The Indian theology hence perceived God's unanimity in His diverse manifestations, each representing this, or that aspect of cosmic existence, though primarily the three, the creation, the sustenance and the dissolution, the first manifesting in Brahma, the second in Vishnu and the third in Shiva. While this Trio defines God's diversified manifestation, the Vishva-roop presents the spiritual perception of His unanimity.
