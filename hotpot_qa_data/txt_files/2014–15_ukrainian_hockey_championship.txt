The 2014â€“15 Ukrainian Hockey Championship was the 23rd season of the Ukrainian Hockey Championship. Only four teams participated in the league this season, because of the instability in Ukraine and that most of the clubs had economical issues. Generals Kiev was the only team that participated in the league the previous season, and the season started first after the year-end of 2014. The regular season included just 12 rounds, where all the teams went to the semifinals. In the final, ATEK Kiev defeated the regular season winner HK Kremenchuk.
