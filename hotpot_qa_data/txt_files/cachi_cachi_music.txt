Cachi Cachi music, also spelled Kachi Kachi, Kachi-Kachi and Katchi-Katchi, is a term that was coined to refer to music played by Puerto Ricans in Hawaii, when they migrated to Hawaii. It is a "variation of dance music found in Hawaii". Sometimes cachi cachi "involves fast, improvised solos" on the guitar. The "influence on Hawai'i endures to this day in the musical form known as "cachi cachi" played on the quarto [sic] and derivative of the Puerto Rican jibaro style." "Jibaro" means peasant in Spanish.
