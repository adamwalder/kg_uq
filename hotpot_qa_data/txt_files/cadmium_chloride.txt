Cadmium chloride is a white crystalline compound of cadmium and chlorine, with the formula CdCl. It is a hygroscopic solid that is highly soluble in water and slightly soluble in alcohol. Although it is considered to be ionic, it has considerable covalent character to its bonding. The crystal structure of cadmium chloride (described below), composed of two-dimensional layers of ions, is a reference for describing other crystal structures. Also known are CdCl•HO and CdCl•5HO.
