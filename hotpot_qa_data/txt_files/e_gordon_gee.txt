Elwood Gordon Gee (born February 2, 1944) is an American academic and is currently serving his second term as President of West Virginia University. He has served as the chief executive at several universities in the United States, previously serving at Ohio State University. Gee had been heading an Ohio State-based think tank following his retirement from the Ohio State presidency on July 1, 2013. He retired in response to a series of controversies relating to comments he made, the last of which involved anti-Catholic comments allegedly made in jest about the University of Notre Dame. His resignation thus ended his second term as the president; he had previously served as president of Ohio State from 1990 to 1997.
