Fish Police is an animated television series from Hanna-Barbera based on the comic book series created by Steve Moncuse. It first aired on CBS in 1992, lasting six episodes over one season. In February of that year, three episodes aired, then the show was axed after falling in the television ratings. The remaining three episodes never aired in the United States, but the entire series ran in European syndication. The show had a decidedly more mature tone than most other animated Hanna-Barbara shows. Episodes often contained innuendo and cases of mild profanity.
