The Glennwanis Hotel is a historic hotel in Glennville, Georgia, Tattnall County, Georgia, built on the site of the Hughes Hotel. The hotel is located at 209-215 East Barnard Street. The old Hughes Hotel was built out of Georgia pine circa 1905 and burned in 1920. The Glennwanis was built in brick in 1926. The local Kiwanis club led the effort to get the replacement hotel built, and organized a Glennville Hotel Company with directors being local business leaders. The wife of a local doctor won a naming contest with the name "Glennwanis Hotel", a suggestion combining "Glennville" and "Kiwanis".
