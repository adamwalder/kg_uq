Gold(III) chloride, traditionally called auric chloride, is a chemical compound of gold and chlorine. With the molecular formula AuCl, the name gold trichloride is a simplification, referring to the empirical formula, AuCl. The Roman numerals in the name indicate that the gold has an oxidation state of +3, which is common for gold compounds. There is also another related chloride of gold, gold(I) chloride (AuCl). Chloroauric acid, HAuCl, the product formed when gold dissolves in aqua regia, is sometimes referred to as "gold chloride" or "acid gold trichloride". Gold(III) chloride is very hygroscopic and highly soluble in water as well as ethanol. It decomposes above 160 °C or in light.
