The Henry Miller Memorial Library is a nonprofit arts center, bookstore, and performance venue, championing the late writer, artist, and Big Sur resident Henry Miller, as well as many other, both living and dead, creative individuals living in or near Big Sur, California. Henry Millerâ€™s friend Emil White built the house that is now the Library in the mid-1960s. After Miller died, in 1980, Emil decided to maintain his property as a memorial to his friend and as a gallery where local artists could show their work. In 1981 Emil White, with the help of the Big Sur Land Trust, created "The Henry Miller Memorial Library, Founded by Emil White."
