Hurt Locker The Musical is a fictional musical in the 2014 Broadway premiere production of "Hedwig and the Angry Inch". In the Broadway performance of "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" the musical opens with Hedwig explaining that the musical only ran for a single night before closing during intermission, and that she has convinced a producer to let her perform in what would otherwise be an empty stage. Fake Playbills for the musical are used as props and are found scattered on the floor of the Belasco Theatre and contains advertisements for other fake musicals based on feature films such as "Gravity on Ice", "Container Store: The Musical", "The Entire Bible", and "SoulCycle on Broadway". The Playbills, which describe the musical as having "explosions, negligible storytelling, camouflage and tits", also state that the musical's cast included actors such as Taye Diggs (who would go on to play the role of Hedwig in the summer of 2015) and that the music was written by Metallica and Stephen R. Schwartz, which is the real name of "Hedwig" songwriter Stephen Trask.
