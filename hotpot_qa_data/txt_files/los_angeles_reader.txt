It is famous for being the first newspaper to publish Matt Groening's cartoon strip, Life in Hell on April 25, 1980. James Vowell hired Matt Groening as his assistant editor in 1979. Groening was also originally a Reader music critic. It also ran a cartoon strip by David Lynch (director of Blue Velvet) called The Angriest Dog in the World, a strip notable for having exactly the same drawing panels for its entire run. James Vowell and his wife Codette Wallace bought the Reader from the Chicago Reader in February 1989. They sold "The Reader" to New Times Media in 1996, which merged it with the "Los Angeles View" to form "New Times LA".
