Louis Stevens (December 25, 1896 â€“ September 29, 1963) was an American screenwriter of the silent and sound film eras. Born on Christmas Day 1896 in Riga, Latvia, Stevens entered the film industry in 1920 when he co-wrote the silent film "A World of Folly", with Jane Grogan. In his over 30-year career he worked on over 40 screenplays, as well as several film shorts and two television series. Among his more notable films were: contributing to the script of the 1931 version of "Dracula", starring Bela Lugosi; co-writing the story for What Price Hollywood? (1932); the screenplay for the 1940 western, "Colorado", directed by Joseph Kane, and starring Roy Rogers; the story for "Streets of Laredo" (1949), starring William Holden, Macdonald Carey and William Bendix; 1951's "The Cimarron Kid", starring Audie Murphy; and "Horizons West" (1952), starring Robert Ryan, Julie Adams, and Rock Hudson. Stevens' final screenplay was for "Flaming Frontier" in 1958, although he did some work on additional dialogue for the 1959 film, "Desert Desperadoes". Stevens also wrote several television episodes, one for "Cheyenne", and two for "Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans", all in 1957.
