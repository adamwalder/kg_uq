Metal Health is the third studio album by American heavy metal band Quiet Riot. It was released on March 11, 1983, bolstered by the No. 5 hit "Cum On Feel the Noize" and the No. 31 hit "Metal Health". "Metal Health" is notable for being the first heavy metal album to reach the top spot on the "Billboard" 200, replacing the Police's "Synchronicity" at number one in November 1983. The album went on to sell more than six million copies and is considered a classic among heavy metal fans. Some critics, such as AllMusic, describe it as a one-hit wonder, owing to Quiet Riot's relative lack of critical and commercial success with following albums (and subsequent disintegration) towards the end of the 1980s. The title track was ranked No. 35 on VH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs.
