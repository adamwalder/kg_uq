Moloch: or, This Gentile World is a semi-autobiographical novel written by Henry Miller in 1927-28, initially under the guise of a novel written by his wife, June. The book went unpublished until 1992, 65 years after it was written and 12 years after Miller’s death. It is widely considered to be of interest more as a study of Miller’s artistic growth than as a worthy piece of fiction.
