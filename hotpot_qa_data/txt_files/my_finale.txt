"My Finale" is the hour-long season finale for season eight of the American sitcom "Scrubs". It was originally broadcast as episodes 18 and 19 of season eight on May 6, 2009, and was intended to be the series finale during production. However, the episode was billed as the "Scrubs finale" as at the time of airing it was unknown whether this would be the series finale or the season finale. The show ended up returning for a ninth season. As the show underwent many changes for the ninth and final season, this is the last episode in which all of the main cast appear as series regulars.
