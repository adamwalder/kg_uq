Ob√∫s is a Spanish heavy metal band created in Madrid in the early 80s. They stood out because they took the risk of making a big spectacle in their concerts in order to reach to the level of other international heavy metal bands. In addition, the lyrics they write and the feelings they transmit connect with the people that follow them. As they said in an interview: "All our songs , some more and some less, have a meaning". Far away from renouncing to their genre, they have always claimed that they were a heavy metal band and they even wrote a song about this genre in their first LP called"Dosis de Heavy Metal".In 2012, because of their 30th anniversary, they did a Tour around Spain.
