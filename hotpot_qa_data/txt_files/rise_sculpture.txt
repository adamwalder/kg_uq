RISE is a concept Â£400,000 public art spherical metal sculpture in Belfast by Wolfgang Buttress. It is 37.5 m high and 30 m wide and was constructed in early 2011 in the centre of the Broadway roundabout, at the junction of the Westlink and M1 motorway, a main gateway to the city where (as of 2009) more than 80,000 cars on average flow past it each day. It is informally known as The Balls on the Falls as this junction also gives access to the Falls Road area via Broadway.
