The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History is a non-fiction book about the American animated television series "The Simpsons". It was written by John Ortved, and first published in October 2009 by Faber and Faber. In the United Kingdom, the book is called Simpsons Confidential: The uncensored, totally unauthorised history of the world's greatest TV show by the people that made it. The book is an oral history of the show, and concentrates particularly on the writers and producers of the show. The book includes entire chapters devoted to key figures such as creator Matt Groening and James L. Brooks and Sam Simon, who helped develop the series. According to National Public Radio reviewer Linda Holmes, "Ortved's thesis, essentially, is that lots of people are responsible for the success of "The Simpsons", and their creator, Matt Groening, has too often been viewed as the sole source to the detriment of others who also deserve to be praised."
