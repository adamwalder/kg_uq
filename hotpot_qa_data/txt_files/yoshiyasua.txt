Yoshiyasua is a grass moth genus (family Crambidae) of subfamily Musotiminae. Some authors have placed it in the snout moth family (Pyralidae), where all grass moths were once also included, but this seems to be in error. The genus contains only one species, Yoshiyasua yasudai, which is found in Japan, where it has been recorded from the Ryukyu Islands.
