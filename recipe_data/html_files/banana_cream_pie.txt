Satisfy your sweet tooth with homemade banana cream pie. This easy banana cream pie recipe is irresistibly sweet with a velvety smooth texture.
Banana Cream Pie Ingredients
These are the ingredients you'll need to make this traditional banana cream pie recipe:
Sugar
: The sweet banana cream pie filling starts with white sugar.
Flour
: All-purpose flour helps thicken the creamy filling.
Salt
: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make your pie taste salty.
Milk
: Two cups of milk lends moisture and thins the filling.
Egg yolks
: Three egg yolks help create a rich, decadent texture.
Butter
: Butter adds even more moisture and richness.
Vanilla
: A dash of vanilla enhances the overall flavor.
Pie shell
: Use a store-bought pastry crust or
make your own at home
. Some reviewers prefer using a
graham cracker crust
.
Bananas
: Of course, you'll need bananas! About four, to be exact.
Tip
: You can substitute 3 tablespoons of cornstarch for the flour.
How to Make Banana Cream Pie
You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade banana cream pie:
Combine the dry ingredients in a saucepan, then stir in the milk.
Bring to a boil and cook until thick.
Whisk some of the milk mixture into the yolks, then whisk the egg mixture into the saucepan.
Cook for two more minutes, then remove from heat and stir in the butter and vanilla.
Place the banana slices in the pie shell, then pour the milk mixture over the bananas.
Bake the pie until the filling is set. Chill before serving.
Can You Make Banana Cream Pie Ahead of Time?
Yes! Since banana cream pie is served chilled, it's a great make-ahead dessert. Simply make it one to two days in advance, then follow the storage instructions below.
How to Store Banana Cream Pie
Loosely cover the banana cream pie with foil or storage wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to three days.
Can You Freeze Banana Cream Pie?
Yes, you can freeze banana cream pie. Simply allow the pie to cool, then wrap the whole pie (dish and all) with storage wrap. Wrap it again in aluminum foil. Freeze for two months. Thaw in the refrigerator.
Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise
"I used a graham cracker crust because that is what I had on hand," says
Elisa
. "And rather than discard the egg whites, I made a meringue topping which browned nicely during the 15 minutes in the oven. It was a big hit!"
"Easy to make and delicious to eat," raves
mespi
. "You can add some coconut flakes on top."
"I used this recipe to make a banana cream trifle," according to
Chuck Z
. "Instead of a pie shell, I placed the pudding mix over some cake, topped with whipped cream, then layered it all again. I loved it."

(9 inch)

4

Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine sugar, flour, and salt in a saucepan. Gradually stir in milk. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until mixture boils and thickens. Continue to cook and stir for 2 more minutes, then remove from the heat.
Place egg yolks in a medium bowl; whisk in a small amount of the hot milk mixture until smooth, then gradually whisk egg yolk mixture into the saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly until mixture coats the back of a spoon, about 2 more minutes. Remove from heat and stir in butter and vanilla.
Fill pastry shell with sliced bananas; pour pudding mixture on top to cover.
Bake in the preheated oven until filling sets, 12 to 15 minutes. Let pie cool completely on a wire rack, then chill pie in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before serving.
