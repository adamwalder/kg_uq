My mother always made these bonbons around Christmas time. Now, I love to carry on the tradition of this delicious sweet confection.

These homemade bonbons are chocolate-covered balls of simple sweetness.
What Is a Bonbon?
A bonbon is a candy that consists of a hard chocolate coating that surrounds a sweet filling. Bonbons are often confused with truffles, but they’re not the same thing — truffles are balls of ganache rolled in cocoa powder.
Bonbon Ingredients
These are the ingredients you’ll need to make this homemade chocolate bonbon recipe:
Butter
: You can use butter or margarine.
Confectioners’ sugar
: You’ll need a whopping two pounds of confectioners’ sugar for this big batch recipe.
Sweetened condensed milk
: A can of sweetened condensed milk is the secret ingredient.
Coconut flakes
and
walnuts
: Coconut flakes and chopped walnuts lend flavor and texture to the filling.
Vanilla
: Vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch.
Chocolate chips
: These decadent bonbons feature a coating of melted semisweet chocolate chips.
Shortening
: Mixing shortening with the melted chocolate chips ensures a shiny, candy-like coating.
How to Make Bonbons
You’ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make these bonbons:
Make the filling, then chill it for at least two hours.
Roll the filling into balls and freeze until hard.
Melt the chocolate and shortening together in a double boiler.
Dip each bonbon in the melted chocolate, then place on wax paper to dry.
Cook’s Note
When the chocolate on the bonbons has hardened, you can store them in a zip-top bag in the freezer to enjoy anytime!
How to Store Bonbons
Store the homemade bonbons in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to five days.
Can You Freeze Bonbons?
Yes, you can freeze the chocolate coconut bonbons for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight.

Ingredients
1
cup
butter or margarine, softened
2
pounds
confectioners' sugar, sifted
1
(14 ounce) can
sweetened condensed milk
3
cups
flaked coconut
1
cup
finely chopped walnuts
1
teaspoon
vanilla extract
1
(12 ounce) package
semisweet chocolate chips
2
tablespoons
shortening
Directions
Mix butter, confectioners' sugar, condensed milk, coconut, chopped walnuts, and vanilla in a large bowl until well combined. Cover and chill in the refrigerator until mixture has thickened enough to roll into balls, about 2 hours.
Roll bonbon mixture into 1-inch balls and place close together, but not touching, on cookie sheets. Freeze until hard.
While bonbons are freezing, line a cookie sheet or flat surface with waxed paper. Combine chocolate chips and shortening in the top of a double boiler, over simmering water; stir until melted.
Dip each bonbon in the melted chocolate using a toothpick or a fork. Place on waxed paper to dry.
