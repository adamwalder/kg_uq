You'll love the contrast of salty-sweet flavors and crispy, chewy textures in this delicious layered dessert. Crisp apple chips bring not only the full fall flavor, but also a satisfying crunch to the chocolate-caramel treat. All you need is 5 ingredients and a microwave to make this no-bake bark, perfect for gifting over the holidays.

Ingredients
2 ½
cups
semisweet chocolate chips, divided
1
cup
crushed pretzels
¾
cup
chopped pecans
1
(11 ounce) package
caramel bits (such as Kraft®)
1
(3.4 ounce) package
apple chips
Directions
Place 2 cups of chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl and melt in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between, until smooth and consistent.
Line a 13x18 baking sheet with parchment. Spread the chocolate onto the baking sheet in a thin, even layer. Allow to cool slightly.
Melt caramel bits in another microwave-safe bowls in 30-second intervals, stirring between, until the caramel bubbles. Quickly drizzle caramel on top of the chocolate, then use a spatula to swirl it evenly around the pan. While the caramel is still warm, top with pretzels, pecans, and apple chips until fully covered. Use another large sheet of parchment paper to gently press the toppings into the caramel. Move to the fridge to chill for 15 minutes.
Melt remaining ½ cup of chocolate chips in the microwave. Transfer to a zip-top bag, cut off a small corner, then drizzle the chocolate evenly over the whole tray.
Move to the fridge to set completely, 2 to 3 hours. Cut in squares or break into large pieces to serve.
