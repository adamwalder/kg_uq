Ingredients
Brownie Mix:
1
(18.25 ounce) package
brownie mix
3
tablespoons
water
½
cup
vegetable oil
2
large
eggs
Cheesecake Topping:
1
(8 ounce) package
cream cheese
1
large
egg
⅓
cup
white sugar
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan.
Prepare brownie mix: Stir brownie mix, water, oil, and eggs in a medium bowl until well blended. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.
Prepare cheesecake topping: Beat together cream cheese, egg, and sugar using an electric mixer until smooth. Dollop the cream cheese mixture on top of the brownie batter. Swirl together using a knife or skewer.
Bake in the preheated oven for 22 to 25 minutes. Brownies will be done when a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Cool in the pan, then cut into 24 squares and serve.
Editor's Note:
The directions for making the brownies are based on a Betty Crocker Fudge Brownie Mix. Follow instructions on the box regarding oven temperature, added ingredients, and cooking time if using a different brand.
