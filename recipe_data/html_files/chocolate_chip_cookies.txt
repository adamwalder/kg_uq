This chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe is as decadent as it gets.
Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies Ingredients
These are the ingredients you’ll need to make this homemade chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe:
Sugar
: The recipe starts with 1 ½ cups white sugar.
Butter
: Beat the sugar with two sticks of softened butter.
Eggs
: Two eggs lend moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.
Vanilla
: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chocolate chip cookies.
Flour
: All-purpose flour gives the cookie dough structure.
Cocoa powder
: They wouldn’t be chocolate chocolate chip cookies without cocoa powder!
Baking
soda
: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.
Salt
: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won’t make the cookies taste salty.
Chocolate chips
: You’ll need two cups of semisweet chocolate chips.
Walnuts (optional)
: Walnuts are optional, but they add welcome crunch.
How to Make Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies
You’ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below – but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make the best chocolate chocolate chip cookies of your life:
Beat the wet ingredients in one bowl and the dry ingredients in another.
Add the dry mixture to the wet mixture, then stir in the chocolate chips and nuts.
Drop the dough onto baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are set.
How to Store Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies
Store the cooled chocolate chocolate chip cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. To ensure the cookies stay soft, you might want to throw in a slice of white bread – it’ll absorb the excess moisture.
Can You Freeze Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies?
Yes! You can freeze baked chocolate chocolate chip cookies and chocolate chocolate chip cookie dough.
To freeze baked cookies
: Allow the baked cookies to cool completely. Arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet, cover, and freeze for about three hours or up to overnight. Transfer the now-frozen cookies to a zip-top bag or freezer-safe container. Wrap in at least one layer of foil for extra protection. Freeze for up to two months.
To freeze cookie dough
: Drop balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover and freeze for about three hours or up to overnight. Transfer the frozen cookies to a zip-top bag or freezer-safe container. Wrap in at least one layer of foil for extra protection. Freeze for up to two months.

Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise
“Great recipe just as written,” according to one Allrecipes community member. “Whenever a cookie recipe calls for butter I always chill the dough for an hour or so before baking as this prevents a flat cookie. The taste of butter can't be beat!”
“Unbelievably good,” raves
Mandi McBride Jensen
. “Soft, chewy, a tiny bit crispy on the edges, perfect chocolate richness. I won’t freely admit to how quickly my son and I devoured an entire batch.”
“These were so easy to make and they were delicious,” says another Allrecipes community member. “I chopped up Andes mints to substitute the chocolate chips and they were so good!!”
