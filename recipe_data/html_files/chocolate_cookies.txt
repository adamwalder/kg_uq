These delicious chocolate cookies taste like brownies. They're crisp on the outside, soft, and fudgy on the inside.

These chocolate cookies are pleasantly chewy, irresistibly decadent, and surprisingly easy to make with basic ingredients.
Chocolate Cookie Ingredients
These are the ingredients you'll need for this top-rated chocolate cookie recipe:
· Sugar
: This chocolate cookie recipe starts with two cups of white sugar.
· Margarine
: This top-rated recipe calls for margarine, but you can use butter if you prefer.
· Eggs
: Two eggs lend moisture and help bind the cookie dough together.
· Vanilla
: Vanilla extract gives the cookies an extra depth of flavor.
· Flour
: All-purpose flour creates structure in the chocolate cookie dough.
· Cocoa powder
: Unsweetened cocoa powder is the key to all that chocolatey goodness.
· Baking soda
: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.
· Salt
: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the cookies, but it won't make them taste salty.
· Nuts
: Walnuts are optional, but they add a welcome crunch. You can use pecans if you prefer.
How to Make Chocolate Cookies
You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make chocolate cookies at home:
1. Cream the sugar and margarine, beat in the eggs, then add the vanilla.
2. Combine the dry ingredients, then add the dry mixture to the wet mixture.
3. Drop the dough by the spoonful onto cookie sheets and bake.
How to Store Chocolate Cookies
Store the cooled chocolate cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. If you throw a piece of white bread into the container, it'll absorb the dry air and keep the cookies soft for longer.
Can You Freeze Chocolate Cookies?
Yes, you can freeze baked chocolate cookies and chocolate cookie dough.
· To freeze baked cookies
: Allow the baked cookies to cool completely. Arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet, cover, and freeze for about three hours or up to overnight. Transfer the now-frozen cookies to a zip-top bag or freezer-safe container. Wrap in at least one layer of foil for extra protection. Freeze for up to two months.
· To freeze cookie dough
: Drop balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover and freeze for about three hours or up to overnight. Transfer the frozen cookies to a zip-top bag or freezer-safe container. Wrap in at least one layer of foil for extra protection. Freeze for up to two months.
