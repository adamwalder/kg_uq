This creamy chicken vegetable soup is pure comfort food and a great way to use leftover chicken. Feel free to play around with the herb combination; I also like it with oregano and dill.

Directions
Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add onion, carrot, and celery. Cook for 5 minutes.
Stir in flour and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in chicken broth; add chicken, potato, peas, corn, parsley, marjoram, thyme, salt, and black pepper. Bring pot to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes.
Stir in half-and-half and simmer until heated through, about 3 minutes. Remove pot from heat and let sit for 10 minutes to thicken.
Cook’s Note
The longer the soup sits off of the heat, the thicker it gets. At 10 minutes, it is the consistency I like, but let it sit longer if you prefer a thicker soup.
