This double chocolate chip cookie recipe is an altered version of a recipe from an old cookbook that took 10 years for me to perfect! I have been told to sell these cookies, they are very, very, very, very good!

Get a double dose of chocolate in every bite with these classic double chocolate chip cookies. No surprises here, these are the real deal! A gloriously soft and chewy chocolate chip cookie made with the addition of cocoa powder for extra chocolaty goodness.
Top Tips
Hundreds of Allrecipes home cooks have made these double chocolate chip cookies with rave reviews all around. Here are some top tips for making these cookies, shared by the Allrecipes community:
Bigger is better
— The recipe states to use tablespoonfuls of cookie dough for these cookies, and the reviews confirm that larger cookies are best with this recipe for a soft and chewy result. Some reviewers complained that smaller cookies turned out to be harder than they would have liked. If you do make smaller cookies, be sure to reduce the baking time accordingly.
Use butter if you like
— Though the recipe calls for margarine, many home cooks have confirmed that they used the same amount of butter instead and the cookies turned out beautifully.
Less sugar
— This is a double chocolate chip cookie, after all, so you can expect these cookies to be sweet. But some have mentioned the cookie is a little too sweet for their tastes and recommend reducing the sugar. "Just use 3/4 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup of brown sugar unless you like your cookies extremely sweet!" says one reviewer.
Chill, then bake
— Some reviewers recommend chilling the cookie dough before baking to lessen the amount the cookies spread.
White chocolate chips
— While any chocolate chip works a treat in these cookies, a lot of home cooks mention using white chocolate chips for a pretty (and tasty!) contrast.
Other additions
— The sky's the limit when it comes to what else you can add to these cookies. Top reviewers mention using everything from peanut butter chips and M&M's to chocolate Rice Krispies and marshmallows!
Allrecipes Community Tips & Praise
"This cookie got rave reviews from everyone when I actually used extra cocoa powder, which not only made a darker, more chocolaty cookie, it also counter-balanced the sweetness of the sugar. My cookies didn't turn out flat at all! They came out big and fluffy, and they stayed chewy all week." —
Helene
"This recipe made such soft cookies, we loved them. The only thing I did different was I put a little bit of espresso powder in to make the chocolate pop a little more." —
Karyn
"The best double-chocolate cookie I have ever made… and possibly the best chocolate chip cookie PERIOD. Make sure to refrigerate your dough for 1-2 hours at least-- this solves the issue with cookies coming out too flat. Also, increase that cocoa up to 1/2 cup. Fantastic recipe. Will be making again and again." —
