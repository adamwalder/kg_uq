Egg drop soup is a favorite of mine. After many trips to different Chinese restaurants to enjoy it, I decided to create the ultimate egg drop soup recipe at home. Sesame oil is the key! I hope you like it as much as I do.

Believe it or not, you can make restaurant-worthy egg drop soup at home with this top-rated recipe!
What Is Egg Drop Soup?
Egg drop soup (or egg flower soup) is a Chinese soup that features silky strands of eggs in chicken broth. The beaten egg is whisked into the boiling broth at the end of cooking, creating delicate strands or flakes that float on top of the broth. It often has seasonings (like salt and white pepper), tofu, and/or some sort of green garnish.
Traditional Chinese egg drop soups tend to have a thinner consistency than Western versions.
How to Make Egg Drop Soup
You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:
Egg Drop Soup Ingredients
These are the simple ingredients you’ll need to make this egg drop soup recipe:
Broth
: Use store-bought or
homemade chicken broth
.
Sauces
and
oils
: Soy sauce and sesame oil lend savory, umami-rich flavor.
Water
and
cornstarch
: A water and cornstarch slurry is optional, but it slightly thickens the soup (this is typical of Western variants).
Egg
: It wouldn’t be “egg drop soup” without an egg!
Food coloring
: You can make the yellow hue more vibrant with food coloring, but it’s not necessary.
Seasonings
: Simply season the egg drop soup with salt and white pepper if you like.
Chives
: Garnish each serving with fresh chives for a pop of bright flavor and color.
How to Make Homemade Egg Drop Soup
Here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this restaurant-quality egg drop soup at home:
Boil the broth with the soy sauce and sesame oil.
Pour the slurry and food coloring into the boiling broth (if using).
Slowly pour in the beaten egg and season.
What to Serve With Egg Drop Soup
Egg drop soup works well as a light entrée, but it is traditionally served as a side dish or appetizer with other
Chinese
or
Asian
fare. Try one of these delicious ideas:
Asian Orange Chicken
Sweet and Sour Pork
Quick Beef Stir-Fry
Chinese Chicken-Fried Rice
Chinese Pepper Steak
How to Store Egg Drop Soup
Store your leftover egg drop soup for up to four days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Reheat on the stove or in the microwave.
Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise
“This was quick, easy, and delicious,” raves one Allrecipes community member. “Sometimes I triple the ingredients and add some Filini to it (but any small pasta will work) to make it a little more hearty and my family loves it!”
“Very tasty and so easy,” according to
Bj King
. “I did not use food coloring and I added powdered bullion for extra flavor.”
“This is a go-to recipe,” says
Lisa Russ-Hiatt
. “Easy and you can adjust the added ingredients to your taste. It tastes just as good as takeout, especially when I make
homemade Crab Rangoon in my air fryer
!”
