This French apple cake is incredibly delicious. France is famous for its fabulously fancy pastries and baked goods, so you might get some skeptic looks when you tell them that this is your favorite apple cake – but trust me – this simple, rustic, easy to make cake is absolutely amazing.

When you think of French cakes, you think “fabulous, fancy, and flamboyant”. France turned making pastries and baked goods into an art form, but in addition to the showstoppers you see in the Pâtisserie window, the country is also known for its simple and rustic desserts. This humble, but amazing, French Apple Cake is my favorite.
Notes From the Chef
This cake is so easy to make and, unlike some versions, is surprisingly light. Even though we’re using lots of apples, the texture is not dense and heavy, which is sometimes the case with this type of cake. Here are some tips to get you started:
The secret is: There is no secret. Just measure carefully, take your time mixing in the eggs, and don’t over bake it. When a toothpick or skewer comes out clean, your cake is done, and you can move on to the real challenge with this recipe, which is what to serve with it.
I went with a simple rum-scented whipped cream, but vanilla ice cream, fresh berries, custard, or a salted caramel sauce would all be spectacular.
But, whether you use one of those classic pairings or simply eat a slice as-is, this is a perfect fall dessert, and I really do hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy!

Ingredients
3
large baking
apples (such as Honeycrisp)
2
teaspoons
apple cider vinegar
1
cup
all purpose flour
1
teaspoon
baking powder
1
teaspoon
kosher salt
1
stick
unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2
cup
white sugar
2
tablespoons
light brown sugar
2
large
eggs
3
tablespoons
dark rum
1/2
teaspoon
vanilla extract
3
tablespoons
white sugar for the top
1
tablespoon
powdered sugar for dusting (optional)
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with butter and line the bottom with parchment paper.
Peel (or leave skin on) and core apples; cut into cubes between 1/4 and 3/8-inch in size. A little smaller is okay, but if your cubes are any larger, they won’t get tender enough when baked.  Add to a large bowl and toss with apple cider vinegar.
Mix together flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl.
In another bowl, beat butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in 1 egg on high speed until it is fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Add the second egg and repeat. Mix in rum, vanilla extract, and 1/2 of the flour mixture.  When the flour disappears add the rest, and fold in with a spatula.
Fold in apples until evenly mixed into the batter. Transfer batter to the prepared pan, making sure all the batter is pressed in firmly. Smooth top and dust with remaining 3 tablespoons sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
Remove cake from oven and let cool in the pan for about 30 minutes. Invert cooled cake onto a wire rack, place a serving plate on top, and flip back over. Dust top with powdered sugar and serve.
