This delicious fudge recipe is easy to make in the microwave with just 3 ingredients: chocolate chips, condensed milk, and butter. Add nuts, mini marshmallows, or candy before chilling to make this treat even more decadent, or try peanut butter chips instead of semisweet chocolate chips to make peanut butter fudge. If you want to have this on hand for the holidays, double the recipe and use a 9x13-inch dish.

What Is Fudge?
Fudge is a type of homemade candy with a smooth and creamy texture. It's usually made on the stove with sugar, butter, and milk. There are many varieties of fudge, but the most popular type is chocolate.
This simplified version comes together quickly in the microwave with just chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, and butter.

How to Make Fudge
You'll be shocked how easy it is to make fudge with sweetened condensed milk. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this easy fudge:

Does Fudge Need to Be Refrigerated?
No, fudge doesn't need to be refrigerated. Store it in an airtight container (with wax paper between layers) at room temperature for one to two weeks.
Can You Freeze Fudge?
Yes! You can freeze fudge for up to three months. Wrap the fudge tightly in wax paper, then wrap it again in aluminum foil. Place the foil-wrapped fudge in a freezer-safe container or wrap it in another layer of foil. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight.

Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise
"This fudge tastes so good and people are amazed that it was made in a microwave," says
StanConn
. "I took the advice from one of the reviews about melting the butter first before adding the other ingredients. I think it really prevented the fudge from turning out grainy."
"I used milk chocolate chips and sprinkled crushed peppermint candy on top," says
LizaJ
. "It made a nice gift to share with neighbors. Quick and easy recipe to make with kids."
"This is perfect fast fudge," according to
weelittlejess
. "No, it's not 'old-fashioned' fudge, but who has the time? Not me. It turns out creamy, glossy, and lovely. I like to stir in a cup of peanut butter chips at the last moment before putting it in the pan."
