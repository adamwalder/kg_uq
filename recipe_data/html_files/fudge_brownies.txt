Ingredients
1
cup
butter
4
(1 ounce) squares
unsweetened chocolate
2
cups
white sugar
4
eggs
1
cup
all-purpose flour
1
teaspoon
vanilla extract
½
teaspoon
salt
2
cups
chopped walnuts
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
In a 3-quart saucepan over very low heat, melt butter and chocolate, stirring the mixture constantly. Remove from heat, and stir sugar into the chocolate. Allow the mixture to cool slightly. Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing well after each, then stir in vanilla. Combine flour and salt; stir into the chocolate mixture. Fold in walnuts. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven, 30 to 35 minutes. Brownies are done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a wire rack.
