No yeast? No problem! This no-yeast pizza dough recipe is not only quicker than traditional dough, it yields perfect homemade pizza crust every time!
No-Yeast Pizza Dough Ingredients
You’ll need just five kitchen staple ingredients to make this no-yeast pizza dough recipe:
Flour
: This yeastless pizza crust starts with all-purpose flour.
Baking powder
: Without yeast, the pizza dough needs baking powder to rise.
Salt
: A pinch of salt enhances the flavor and strengthens the gluten.
Milk
: You’ll need ½ cup of fat-free milk.
Olive oil
: Olive oil locks in moisture and keeps the dough from drying out.
How to Make No-Yeast Pizza Dough
Ready to learn how to make pizza dough without yeast? You’ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect:
Mix the dry ingredients, then stir in the wet ingredients until a dough forms.
Turn out the dough and knead.
Shape the dough into a ball and let rise.
Roll the dough out into a circle.
Tip from recipe creator
Missy
: “If the dough is too dry, add a little more milk.”
How to Use No-Yeast Pizza Dough
To use your homemade no-yeast pizza dough:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake the crust in the preheated oven for 8 minutes.
Top with your favorite toppings and bake until the crust is golden brown, about 10 to 15 minutes more.
Can You Make No-Yeast Pizza Dough Ahead of Time?
If you’re short on time, you can make the no-yeast pizza dough up to one day in advance. Simply store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Once the dough is baked, you can store it in the refrigerator for up to three days.
