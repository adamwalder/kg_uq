These decadent Nutella cookies are rich, flavorful, and surprisingly easy to make.
Nutella Cookie Ingredients
These are the ingredients you’ll need to make this top-rated Nutella cookie recipe:
Flour
: This recipe starts with all-purpose flour, which gives the dough structure.
Cocoa powder
: You’ll need cocoa powder for these super chocolatey cookies.
Baking soda
: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.
Salt
: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won’t make the cookies taste salty.
Butter
: Two sticks of butter lend moisture and flavor.
Sugars
: You’ll need both brown and white sugars for these sweet cookies.
Eggs
: Eggs add moisture and help bind the dough together.
Vanilla
: Vanilla extract takes the indulgent flavor up a notch.
Chocolate-hazelnut spread
: Of course, you’ll need chocolate hazelnut spread (such as Nutella)!
Mix-ins
: Hazelnuts and chocolate chips are optional, but they make for a more flavorful and complex cookie.
How to Make Nutella Cookies
You’ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make Nutella cookies:
Mix the dry ingredients in one bowl and the wet ingredients in another.
Slowly add the dry mix to the wet mix, then fold in the mix-ins.
Drop the dough onto a prepared cookie sheet using a tablespoon or cookie scoop.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are dry and the cookies are fragrant.
How to Store Nutella Cookies
Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to three days.
Can You Freeze Nutella Cookies?
Sure! But it’s best to freeze the cookies before baking. When you're ready to make them, simply bake them according to the recipe. Freeze the dough balls for up to three months.
