These Oreo balls will be a hit at any occasion! Made with just a few simple ingredients, this Oreo ball recipe is the perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth.
Oreo Balls Ingredients
You'll need just three ingredients to make this bakery-worthy Oreo ball recipe:
Oreos
: Of course, you'll need Oreos! Finely crush them using a zip-top bag and a rolling pin.
Cream cheese
: A block of cream cheese lends tons of tangy richness. Plus, it binds the crushed Oreos together into a ball.
Baking chocolate
: This Oreo ball cookie recipe calls for semi-sweet baking chocolate, but you can use dark or white baking chocolate if you prefer.
You'll also need toothpicks and wax paper.
How to Make Oreo Balls
Making Oreo balls couldn't be easier. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:
Mix the crushed cookies and cream cheese, then form the mixture into balls. Chill until firm, dip in melted chocolate, and chill again.
How to Dip Oreo Balls In Chocolate
Stick a toothpick in the chilled cookie ball to easily dip the whole thing in chocolate. When you remove the toothpick, you might see a tiny hole. That's fine! Just cover it up with more chocolate.
From the Editor
Feeling festive? Try one of these holiday-perfect variations next time you make these Oreo cookie balls:
Snowmen Oreo Cookie Balls
: Give your cookie balls variety by decorating them as snowmen. Substitute white chocolate for semi-sweet chocolate and decorate with a snowman face using decorating gels and frostings.
Christmas Tree Oreo Cookie Balls
: Get in the holiday spirit by decorating the cookie balls as Christmas trees. Substitute white chocolate for semi-sweet chocolate and decorate with a Christmas tree design using decorating frosting and a cinnamon candy on the top.
Do Oreo Balls Need to Be Refrigerated?
One of the main ingredients in this Oreo cookie ball recipe is cream cheese, so they need to be refrigerated. They shouldn't sit at room temperature for more than two hours at a time. Store the cookies in an airtight container in the fridge for about two to three weeks.
Can You Freeze Oreo Balls?
Yes, you can freeze Oreo balls. Flash freeze them on a baking sheet for a few hours or up to overnight, transfer the frozen balls to a freezer-safe bag, and freeze for up to two months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight.
Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise
"I make these for work and they vanish almost instantly with rave reviews from everyone," says
ImplosionsOfJello
. "They're super easy to make and once you get your rhythm down they're fairly quick to make as well."
"With white chocolate, it's superb," according to
Safrafraya
. "Don't make the chocolate coating too thick because then it overpowers the Oreo itself. My all time favorite dessert."
"I made them with mint Oreos for my husband's birthday on St. Patrick's Day," says
Grace Fitzjerrell Lueras
. "I had the lemon Oreo dipped in white chocolate at a baby shower a couple of weeks ago, and understood why people love these Oreo truffles."
