These pecan shortbread cookies have a nice crisp texture and are studded generously with pecans. Rimmed in golden demerara sugar, these cookies are beautiful enough to give as a gift.

Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Beat butter, white sugar, and vanilla together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until combined.
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Add flour, pecans, and salt. Beat on low with the electric mixer until dough comes together.
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Line a work surface with a piece of plastic wrap about 12 inches long. Divide dough in 2 equal portions. Place a portion of dough on the plastic wrap. Using the plastic wrap to assist you, shape and roll dough into a round log about 1 1/2 inches wide and 10 inches long. If dough is a little crumbly, press it together firmly. Repeat with the remaining dough.
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap and chill for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.
Whisk egg yolk and 1 teaspoon water together in a small bowl with a fork. Pour demerara sugar on a rimmed baking sheet or 13x9-inch baking pan.
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Unwrap dough and brush with egg yolk mixture. Using the ends of the plastic wrap to hold the log, press all sides into demerara sugar.
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Slice dough logs into 1/2-inch thick rounds with a sharp knife. Place on the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate between batches.
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned on the bottom, about 16 minutes.
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
