We have over 130 recipes for homemade pumpkin pie here at Allrecipes, but this recipe takes the cake (or pie) with over 2,600 five-star ratings. And it's proof that a good recipe doesn't necessarily need to be a complicated one — you get a great result with canned pumpkin puree and store-bought pie crust. Of course, you can customize it to suit your preferences by using fresh pumpkin or a
homemade pie crust
for that from-scratch taste. Plus, it can be made ahead of time and refrigerated (or frozen) until you're ready to serve! Your search for the perfect pumpkin pie ends here.
How to Make Pumpkin Pie
Here's what we love about this recipe: This pie is incredibly approachable, even for novice bakers. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:
Make the filling.
Pour the mixture into the crust.
Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat and continue baking.
Test Kitchen Tips
“This is not only the perfect pumpkin pie recipe, it’ll be the easiest one you make all year,” says culinary producer and test kitchen expert
Nicole McLaughlin
. Here are some of her best tips and tricks for perfecting this easy recipe:
If the unbaked filling has any bubbles after you pour it into the pie shell, you can give it a gentle tap or two on the counter. They should disappear easily.
Letting the pie cool completely before slicing is essential. Nicole prefers her pumpkin pie cold, so she chills it in the fridge after letting it come to room temperature.
“Only
homemade whipped cream
will do” for this perfect pumpkin pie, according to Nicole.
Do You Need to Blind Bake the Pie Crust?
Blind baking refers to baking pie crust, either partially or completely, without filling it. Why would you do this? Pie with a custard-based filling, such as pumpkin, generally requires little oven time, which means you may want to give your crust a bit of a head start to ensure you don't end up with a raw, soggy bottom.
Several reviewers suggest blind baking the pie crust in the recipe, particularly if you're using a homemade pie crust. Learn step-by-step
how to blind bake a pie crust
, whether store-bought or homemade. If you're using a frozen pie crust, you can often find instructions for blind baking on the package.

Fresh or Canned Pumpkin in Pumpkin Pie?
Note that this recipe calls for canned pumpkin, not "pumpkin pie filling," which is already spiced. If you plan to use the spices and sweeteners called for in this recipe, go for unflavored canned pumpkin.
While there's no shame in using canned pumpkin, some folks prefer the flavor and satisfaction you get from using fresh pumpkin. If that's you, use
this recipe
for making pumpkin puree from scratch. A 1 ½-pound pumpkin yields about 2 cups mashed pumpkin, the same as a 15-ounce can of pumpkin puree.
Can You Use Pumpkin Pie Spice?
Several reviewers call out using ready-made pumpkin pie spice — a combination of ground cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, and sometimes cloves and mace — and additional cinnamon in place of the spices called for: "I followed a suggestion that someone else had made and used 2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and 2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon instead," says reviewer
Devin
. Some folks prefer the taste of the store-bought pumpkin pie spice to the individual spices, but ultimately it's a matter of personal preference (and convenience!).
Does Pumpkin Pie Need to Be Refrigerated?
Yes,
pumpkin pie needs to be stored in the refrigerator
as it is an "egg rich pie," according to the
USDA
. Do allow your pie ample time to cool before refrigerating it (this will also give the filling time to set), but don't leave it out at room temperature for more than 2 hours, otherwise there's a risk of bacteria growth. Pumpkin pie will last up to three to four days in the fridge. If you plan to make pumpkin pie in advance, we'd suggest making it one to two days in advance and refrigerating — this way you'll still have a couple days for leftovers, too!
Can You Freeze Pumpkin Pie?
Custard-based pies freeze remarkably well, so you can absolutely make pumpkin pie ahead of time and freeze it for up to one month in advance (hello, stress-free holidays). If you go this route, we do suggest baking your pie in an aluminum pie pan.
To freeze pumpkin pie, bake your pie and allow it to cool completely. Then wrap it in several layers of plastic wrap, and follow with an additional layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up to one month. When you're ready to serve, remove the aluminum foil and allow the pie to defrost overnight in the refrigerator.
How to Make Whipped Cream for Pumpkin Pie
Cracked pie? Whipped cream to the rescue! Use homemade or store-bought whipped cream with a sprinkle of cinnamon to cover any imperfections on your pie. To make homemade whipped cream, follow this
top-rated whipped cream recipe
.
Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise
"Outstanding flavor and very easy to make. Two combinations I love," says reviewer
TaoWine
.
"I used fresh pumpkin puree instead of canned pumpkin, which I would recommend because it is fresher and gives more texture," suggests reviewer
MadameD
. "Also, if you are using a homemade pie crust, I recommend you bake it a tad before adding the filling."
