Ingredients
5
tablespoons
reduced-sodium soy sauce
2
tablespoons
rice wine vinegar
1
tablespoon
cornstarch
2
tablespoons
sesame oil, divided
1
(1 pound)
pork tenderloin, cut into strips
1
fresh red chile pepper, chopped
2
cloves
garlic, minced
1
onion, chopped
1
green bell pepper, chopped
1
head
bok choy, leaves and stalks separated, chopped
2
crowns
broccoli, chopped
1
teaspoon
ground ginger
Directions
Whisk soy sauce, vinegar, and cornstarch together in a small bowl; set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Cook and stir tenderloin strips in hot oil until just browned, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate and return the wok to heat.
Add remaining sesame oil to the wok; cook and stir red chile pepper and garlic in hot oil until sizzling, 15 to 30 seconds. Add onion and bell pepper; cook and stir until onion starts to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir chopped bok choy stalks into onion mixture; cook and stir until stems begin to soften, about 3 minutes.
Add broccoli to the wok; cook and stir until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add pork, chopped bok choy leaves, and soy sauce mixture; cook and stir until well-combined. Season pork mixture with ginger; cook and stir until bok choy leaves start to wilt and broccoli is tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
