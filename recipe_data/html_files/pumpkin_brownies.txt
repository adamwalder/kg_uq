How to Make Pumpkin Brownies
footballgrl16
You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make these top-rated pumpkin brownies:
1. Make the batter base
: Stir the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Stir sugar, melted butter, and vanilla together in a large bowl. Add eggs one at a time. Gradually add flour mixture and stir until the batter is smooth.
2. Separate the batters
: Pour half of the batter into the medium bowl. Stir chocolate chips and cocoa into one bowl of batter. Stir pumpkin puree, walnuts, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg into the second bowl.
3. Layer and swirl the batters
: Spread half of the chocolate batter into the bottom of a prepared baking pan. Spread half of the pumpkin batter on top. Repeat the layers with the remaining batters. Drag a knife or small spatula through the layers in a swirling motion.
4. Bake the brownies
: Bake the brownies in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the brownies to cool completely before cutting them into 16 even squares.
Can You Make Pumpkin Brownies Ahead of Time?

Yes! These pumpkin brownies are a great make-ahead dessert. They'll last for a few days on the counter or for about a week in the fridge.
How to Store Pumpkin Brownies
My Hot Southern Mess
Store the brownies in an airtight container or stack them in zip-top bags. They'll last for three to four days at room temperature or up to a week in the fridge.
Can You Freeze Pumpkin Brownies?
Yes, you can definitely freeze these pumpkin brownies. Allow them to cool completely, then arrange them in a single layer in a freezer-safe container or zip-top freezer bag. Freeze them for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight.

Directions
Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking pan.
Stir flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl.
Stir sugar, melted butter, and vanilla together in a large bowl.
Add one egg and mix with a spoon until well incorporated. Repeat to add remaining 2 eggs, mixing well after each addition.
Gradually add flour mixture and stir the batter until evenly moistened. Pour 1/2 of the batter back into the medium bowl that held the flour mixture.
Stir chocolate chips and cocoa into one bowl of batter. Stir pumpkin puree, walnuts, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg into the second bowl of batter.
Spread 1/2 of the chocolate batter into the bottom of the prepared baking pan, and follow with 1/2 of the pumpkin batter. Repeat the two layers once more.
Drag a kitchen knife or small spatula gently through the layers in a swirling motion to create a marbled appearance.
Bake in the preheated oven until the brownies begin to pull away from the sides of the pan, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan before cutting into 16 squares.
Serve warm, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Enjoy!
