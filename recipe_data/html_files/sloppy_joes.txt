There's nothing quite like Sloppy Joes to satisfy your comfort food cravings. This crowd-pleasing Sloppy Joe recipe will make you nostalgic for simpler times. Plus, it comes together quickly with ingredients you likely already have on hand.
What Is a Sloppy Joe?
A Sloppy Joe is a sandwich consisting of ground beef and onions in a tomato-based sauce served on a hamburger bun.
The sandwich likely originated in Sioux City, Iowa in the 1930s. According to legend, the "loose meat sandwich" was the creation of a cook named Joe.
How to Make Sloppy Joes
You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make these classic Sloppy Joes:
1. Cook the beef, onion, and green pepper.
2. Drain the liquids, then stir in the remaining ingredients.
3. Simmer for about 30 minutes. Serve on hamburger buns.

Nicole's Top Sloppy Joe Tips
"There's no need to pull out any of that canned stuff," according to Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a.
NicoleMcMom
), who says you've already got everything you need to make a perfect Sloppy Joe sitting in your pantry. Here are a few of her favorite Sloppy Joe tips and tricks:
·
Nicole doesn't like to drain the meat after she cooks it (she likes to use the rendered fat to saute the onions and bell peppers), so she prefers using a lean meat.
·
"When it comes to the bun," Nicole says, "the cheaper the better." For the classic Sloppy Joe experience, you want it to absorb all the excess liquid.
·
Make sure to overfill the bun so that some meat spills out. Why? So you can scoop it up with potato chips, of course!
What to Serve With Sloppy Joes

Ingredients
1
pound
lean ground beef
¼
cup
chopped onion
¼
cup
chopped green bell pepper
¾
cup
ketchup, or to taste
1
tablespoon
brown sugar, or to taste
1

Directions
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir lean ground beef in the hot skillet until some of the fat starts to render, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion and bell pepper; continue to cook until vegetables have softened and beef is cooked through, 3 to 5 more minutes.
Stir in ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and garlic powder; season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.
Divide meat mixture evenly among hamburger buns.

Recipe Tip
If using ground beef with a higher fat content than lean, be sure to drain any fat before starting Step 2.
