When I got a request for this recently, I did a search, and realized South Shore Bar Pizza was the same thing we grew up eating, except we called it cracker crust pizza–the style of pizza we got anytime we’d go to a bowling alley, a movie theater, or any kind of snack bar location. It’s probably the easiest pizza to make, and I’m excited to share my take with you.

I received a food wish recently for something called South Shore Bar Pizza, and I got very excited since I love discovering, and sharing, new and regional specialties (especially regional pizza specialties). But, as I started to research this “new” dish from the Boston area, I realized it wasn’t new to me at all. Yes, the name was unfamiliar, but the pizza was not.
Notes From the Chef
I grew up eating this style, which we called, “cracker crust pizza,” and it’s what you’d get in any kind of snack bar setting. Whether it was the bowling alley, a sporting event, or movie theater, this ultra-thin crust pizza was ubiquitous. As I got older and progressed through my culinary career, I’d look down on this style of pizza that I thought of as simple and unsophisticated, but I’ve rediscovered just how enjoyable it actually is.
As I mentioned in the video, if you’ve not had the best luck making pizza at home, this is the style for you. While it does take a while to rise, the dough is dead simple and very easy to work with. There’s no rolling or spinning here: We simply press it flat…
very
flat…top it, then pop it in the oven.
Whether you’re a pizza making novice or a jaded professional, this is a great pizza. I really do hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy!

Ingredients
Pizza Dough:
2 1/4
teaspoons
dry active yeast (1 packet)
1 1/2
teaspoons
white sugar
1
cup
warm
water, at about 105 degrees F (41 degrees C)
3 2/3
cups
all-purpose flour or
bread flour
1 1/2
teaspoons
kosher salt
2
tablespoons
melted
unsalted butter
2
tablespoons
corn oil or other vegetable oil
Sauce:
1 1/2
cups
San Marzano
tomato puree (from 1 can San Marzano tomatoes), or plain tomato sauce
1
teaspoon
kosher salt
1/2
teaspoon
dried oregano, or to taste
1
pinch
cayenne pepper
Pizzas:
1/2
cup
corn oil, divided, to grease pizza pans
8
ounces
grated sharp
white Cheddar cheese
8
ounces
grated M
onterey Jack cheese
Directions
Stir yeast, sugar, and water together in a bowl; let sit for about 10 minutes.
Stir in flour and mix until a dry, shaggy dough forms. Add salt, butter, and 2 tablespoons oil and mix to combine.
Knead with your hands in the bowl until dough comes together, then turn out onto the counter and continue to knead until a stiff but smooth dough forms, about 1 to 2 minutes.
Return dough to the bowl; rub the surface of the dough with a small amount of oil. Cover the bowl and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, up to 6 hours. Alternately, place dough in the refrigerator to rise overnight.
Meanwhile, make the pizza sauce. Blend San Marzano tomatoes until smooth using a stick blender or in the jar of an electric blender. Measure out 1 1/2 cups of the tomato puree and place into a bowl. Stir in 1 teaspoon kosher salt, dried oregano, and cayenne pepper. Refrigerate until ready to make the pizzas.
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Drizzle 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons oil into a 10- to 12-inch pizza pan.
Divide dough into 4 pieces and roll into balls. Keep dough covered when not using. Press 1 dough ball into a round disc and place on the prepared pizza pan. Press and stretch dough flat, almost all the way to the edge of the pan. Poke the dough all over with a fork.
Once the dough is properly punctured, top with about 1/3 cup sauce, spreading all the way to the edge of dough. Top the entire surface with 2 ounces each of Cheddar cheese and Monterey Jack cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and bottom of pizza is browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 3 more pizzas.
