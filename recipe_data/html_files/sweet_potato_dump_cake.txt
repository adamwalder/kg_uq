Beat until soft peaks form.
Cover and store in the refrigerator for 3 days.
How to Make Sweet Potato Dump Cake
You’ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade sweet potato dump cake:
Beat the sweet potatoes, a stick of melted butter, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla, and spice in a large mixing bowl until almost smooth.
Spread the sweet potato mixture evenly into the prepared pan, then sprinkle with cake mix.
Place cold butter pieces evenly over cake mix and sprinkle with pecans.
Bake until golden brown and set.
Test Kitchen Tips
This recipe was developed in our test kitchen. Check out some tips and tricks from culinary experts that might make the cooking process easier:
For a slightly less sweet cake, substitute three cups of canned sweet potato puree for the drained sweet potatoes
You can also use fresh sweet potatoes, if you prefer a less sweet cake. Find sweet potato cooking instructions below.
Don’t forget to let the cake sit in the pan for about 20 minutes before serving, as it needs time to set completely.
If you’d like to customize this cake, add marshmallows to the top in the last 5 minutes or add coconut to the cake before baking.
Recipe Tip
To cook a sweet potato:
Cut peeled sweet potatoes into 1” cubes.
Boil for 12-15 minutes, or until very tender, drain.
Three medium sweet potatoes will yield approximately three cups puree.
How to Store Sweet Potato Dump Cake
Allow the cake to cool completely, then cover tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to five days.
