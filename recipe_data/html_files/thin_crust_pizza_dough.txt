Ingredients
1
teaspoon
active dry yeast
¼
teaspoon
white sugar
¾
cup
lukewarm water
2
cups
all-purpose flour, divided
½
teaspoon
salt
Directions
Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water that's 110 degrees F (44 degrees C) in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 8 minutes.
Combine 1 3/4 cups flour and salt in a large bowl. Pour in yeast mixture; mix well until dough comes together.
Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup flour if dough is too sticky.
Roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a greased pizza pan.
To Bake:
Top crust as desired and bake at 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) until golden, 8 to 10 minutes.
