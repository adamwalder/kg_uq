Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir together cookie crumbs and melted butter in a bowl until combined. Press crumb mixture into a deep-dish 9-inch pie plate.
Bake in the preheated oven until slightly golden brown, 10 to 13 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack.
Beat together Twix spread and cream cheese with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth.
Combine cream and powdered sugar in a bowl, and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form. Reserve 1 cup of the whipped cream, and fold remaining cream into Twix spread mixture.
Pour Twix mixture into cooled crust. Top evenly with reserved whipped cream, and chill at least 2 hours or overnight. Drizzle with caramel topping, and sprinkle with chopped Twix bars.
