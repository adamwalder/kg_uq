The ingredients for making cheesecake brownies are brownie mix, water, vegetable oil, eggs, cream cheese, white sugar
To make cheesecake brownies, first preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and grease a 9x13-inch pan. In a medium bowl, stir together the brownie mix, water, oil, and eggs until well blended. Spread the brownie batter evenly into the prepared pan. In a separate bowl, beat together the cream cheese, egg, and sugar until smooth. Dollop the cream cheese mixture on top of the brownie batter and swirl together using a knife or skewer. Bake in the preheated oven for 22 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Allow the brownies to cool in the pan, then cut into 24 squares and serve.
