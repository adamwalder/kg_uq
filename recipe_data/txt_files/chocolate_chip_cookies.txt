The ingredients for making chocolate chip cookies are sugar (1 ½ cups), butter (two sticks), eggs (two), vanilla extract, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, chocolate chips (two cups), walnuts (optional)
To make chocolate chip cookies, start by creaming together 1 ½ cups of white sugar and two sticks of softened butter. Then, beat in two eggs and add vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, sift together all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and a pinch of salt. Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet mixture and stir in two cups of semisweet chocolate chips. Drop spoonfuls of dough onto greased cookie sheets and bake at 375 degrees F for 8 to 10 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on a wire rack before serving.
