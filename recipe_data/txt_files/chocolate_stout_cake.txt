The ingredients for making chocolate stout cake are sour cream, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, dry ingredients, cooled stout mixture, cake pans, serving platter, 1 cup frosting
To make chocolate stout cake, start by preheating the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and greasing and flouring two 9-inch round cake pans. In a separate bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl or stand mixer, beat butter, vegetable oil, dark brown sugar, and white sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in sour cream and vanilla extract. Gradually add dry ingredients, alternating with cooled stout mixture, until just combined. Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans and tap them on the counter to remove air bubbles. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the cakes spring back lightly when touched. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 20 to 30 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, place one cake layer on a serving platter and spread about 1 cup of frosting on top. Place the remaining cake layer on top and pour the remaining frosting over the cake, smoothing it over the top and sides until completely frosted.
