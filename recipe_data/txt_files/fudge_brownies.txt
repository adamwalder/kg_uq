The ingredients for making fudge brownies are butter (1 cup), unsweetened chocolate (4 (1 ounce) squares), white sugar (2 cups), eggs (4), all-purpose flour (1 cup), vanilla extract (1 teaspoon), salt (Â½ teaspoon), chopped walnuts (2 cups)
To make fudge brownies, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. In a saucepan, melt butter and unsweetened chocolate over low heat. Remove from heat and stir in sugar. Let it cool slightly. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla. Combine flour and salt, then stir into the chocolate mixture. Fold in chopped walnuts. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a wire rack.
