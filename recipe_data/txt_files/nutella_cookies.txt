To make Nutella cookies, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a bowl, combine 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, ¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda, and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix with a whisk to break up any lumps. In a separate large bowl, beat 1 cup room temperature butter, ¾ cup brown sugar, and ¾ cup white sugar until smooth. Beat in 2 large eggs one at a time, then mix in 2 tablespoons vanilla extract and ½ cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella). Slowly add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and stir just until combined. Fold in ½ cup chopped toasted hazelnuts and 1 cup chocolate chips. Drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheet by tablespoons or with a cookie scoop. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the edges look dry and the cookies are fragrant. Allow them to cool briefly on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack..
