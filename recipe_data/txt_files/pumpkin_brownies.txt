The ingredients for making pumpkin brownies are flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, melted butter, vanilla, eggs, chocolate chips, cocoa, pumpkin puree, walnuts, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg
To make pumpkin brownies, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and grease an 8-inch square baking pan. In a medium bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, and salt. In a large bowl, stir together sugar, melted butter, and vanilla. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Gradually add the flour mixture to the batter and stir until evenly moistened. Pour half of the batter into a separate bowl. Stir chocolate chips and cocoa into one bowl of batter, and stir pumpkin puree, walnuts, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg into the other bowl. Spread half of the chocolate batter into the bottom of the prepared baking pan, followed by half of the pumpkin batter. Repeat the layers once more. Use a knife or spatula to gently swirl the layers together. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until the brownies pull away from the sides of the pan and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool in the pan before cutting into squares. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.
