To make sweet potato dump cake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. In a large bowl, combine drained sweet potatoes, melted butter, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla, and pumpkin pie spice. Beat until almost smooth. Spread the sweet potato mixture evenly into the prepared pan. Sprinkle cake mix over the sweet potato mixture. Place cold butter pieces evenly over the cake mix. Sprinkle with pecans if desired. Bake for about 45 minutes until golden brown and set. Cool for at least 20 minutes before serving. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream if desired.
