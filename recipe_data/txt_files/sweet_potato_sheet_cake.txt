The ingredients for making sweet potato sheet cake are sweet potatoes, box mix, mashed canned sweet potatoes
To make sweet potato sheet cake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and spray a 9x13-inch pan with nonstick cooking spray. In a bowl, whisk together a yellow cake mix, mashed sweet potatoes, eggs, milk, and oil. Stir in chopped nuts and spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool on a wire rack. In another bowl, beat softened Neufch√¢tel cheese, softened butter, and vanilla extract together. Add powdered sugar and beat until well combined. Spread the frosting evenly over the cooled cake and sprinkle with chopped nuts.
